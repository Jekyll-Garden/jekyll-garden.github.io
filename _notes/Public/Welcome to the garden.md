# Welcome to Jekyll Garden

Jekyll Garden is a clean, minimal Jekyll theme that makes publishing your Obsidian vault as a static website incredibly easy. Think of it as a bridge between your private knowledge base and the public web.

## What makes it special?

- **Simple Setup**: Just add your notes to the `_notes` folder and they automatically become web pages
- **Wiki-style Links**: Use `[[note title]]` syntax just like in Obsidian
- **Automatic Backlinks**: See which notes link to the current one
- **Clean Design**: Minimal, typography-focused design that's easy to read
- **Search**: Full-text search across all your notes
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes with persistent preference

## Quick Start

1. **Add notes** to the `_notes` folder
2. **Use wiki links** like `[[Getting Started]]` to connect ideas
3. **Configure** your site in `_config.yml`
4. **Deploy** to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting
