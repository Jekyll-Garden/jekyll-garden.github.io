Jekyll Garden comes with several features that make it easy to create and navigate your digital garden.

## Wiki-Style Links
Connect your notes using `[[note title]]` syntax, just like in Obsidian. Links are created automatically and work seamlessly across your site.

## Full-Text Search
Find any note quickly with the built-in search feature. Search works across note titles and content, with results updating as you type.

## Automatic Backlinks
See which notes link to the current one. This helps you discover related content and explore connections between your ideas.

## Dark/Light Theme
Toggle between light and dark themes with a single click. Your preference is saved and remembered for future visits.

## Responsive Design
Your site looks great on all devices - phones, tablets, and computers. The design adapts automatically to different screen sizes.

## Math Support
Write mathematical expressions using KaTeX. Use `$x = y$` for inline math and `$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$` for block equations.

## Blog Integration
Supports jekyll blog. Write chronological blog posts in the `_posts` folder and link them to your notes.


## Customizable
Easily customize colors, fonts, and layout by editing CSS variables. See the [[Customization]] guide for details.
