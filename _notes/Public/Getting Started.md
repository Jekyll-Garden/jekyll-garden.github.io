Jekyll Garden makes it easy to turn your Obsidian notes into a website. Here's how to get started:

## Quick Setup

1. **Download this theme** to your computer
2. **Add your notes** to the `_notes` folder (each note is a markdown file)
3. **Edit `_config.yml`** to set your site's title and information
4. **Deploy** to GitHub Pages or Netlify

## Adding Your First Note

Create a new markdown file in the `_notes` folder:

```yaml
---
title: "My First Note"
date: 2024-01-15
feed: "show"
---
```

Then write your content using [[Wiki Links]] to connect to other notes.

- Learn how to use [[Wiki Links]] to connect your notes
- See the [[Markdown Guide]] for formatting help
- Customize your site with the [[Customization]] guide
- Deploy your site using the [[Deployment]] instructions

## Tips

- **Start small**: Add a few notes first to see how it works
- **Use descriptive titles**: They become your URLs and link targets
- **Link liberally**: The more connections, the better your garden grows
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on content, not complex formatting
