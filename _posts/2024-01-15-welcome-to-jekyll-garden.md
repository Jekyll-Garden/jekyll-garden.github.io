Jekyll Garden is a thoughtfully minimal theme for Jekyll that transforms your Obsidian vault into a beautiful, interconnected website. It's designed for those who value clarity and focus, letting your notes and ideas shine without distraction.

## What Makes It Special

- **Wiki-style Links**: Connect ideas with `[[note title]]` syntax
- **Clean Design**: Minimal, typography-focused layout
- **Fast Performance**: Static site generation for speed
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across all content
