# About Jekyll Garden

Jekyll Garden is a clean, minimal Jekyll theme designed to make publishing your Obsidian vault as a static website incredibly easy. It bridges the gap between private knowledge management and public sharing.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of interconnected notes that grow and evolve over time. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, digital gardens focus on evergreen content that's linked together through wiki-style connections.

Think of it as your personal Wikipedia - a living knowledge base that you can share with the world.

## Why Jekyll Garden?

### Simple Setup
- Fork the repository and you're ready to go
- No complex configuration required
- Works with any static hosting service

### Obsidian Compatible
- Use the same `[[wiki links]]` syntax as Obsidian
- Automatic backlinks and link previews
- Seamless workflow from private to public

### Clean Design
- Minimal, typography-focused design
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive and accessible

### Powerful Features
- Full-text search across all notes
- Math expression support with KaTeX

## How It Works
