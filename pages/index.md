Jekyll Garden is a simple theme that turns your Obsidian notes into a beautiful website. If you use Obsidian for note-taking, this theme makes it easy to publish your markdown files as a connected website with wiki-style links and full-text search.

Start by reading [[Getting Started]] to set up your own Jekyll Garden. Learn how to use [[Wiki Links]] to connect your notes, explore the [[Markdown Guide]] for formatting, and customize your site with the [[Customization]] guide. When you're ready to share your notes online, follow the [[Deployment]] instructions.
